How to access the game. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services.

##Usage and Features

Click a space in the gameboard to make the first move, a cross. It is then the other players turn to place a circle in a different space. Don't try and use the same space!! Take turns clicking spaces to make noughts and crosses. The first person to get three in a row wins! It can be diagonally, vertically, or horizontally! Fun!

The game can be enjoyed by all age groups, from any background, in a variety of settings. It may be a useful tool to see who is superior at space perception based games. In most cases, however, it will result in draw after draw, making it a futile game. 

That's why we have a size adjuster! It is unclear presently whether this will result in more or fewer draws, that's up to you! 

##Roadmap and Wishlist

- Add more dynamic formatting so any size game fits!
- Add a selector to change how many consecutive moves it takes to score a win!
- Responsive design
- Multi-language Support
    - Chinese
    - Spanish
